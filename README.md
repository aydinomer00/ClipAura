# ClipAura 📋✨

## The Ultimate macOS Clipboard Manager for Power Users
ClipAura transforms your copy-paste workflow into a supercharged productivity engine. This elegant, lightweight clipboard manager sits quietly in your menu bar while intelligently capturing, organizing, and securing everything you copy. Whether you're a developer juggling code snippets, a writer managing research notes, or a designer handling multiple assets, ClipAura ensures you'll never lose important copied content again.

## 🎯 What Makes ClipAura Special?
ClipAura isn't just another clipboard manager – it's your digital memory assistant. Built from the ground up with modern Swift and SwiftUI, this native macOS application understands the nuances of your workflow and adapts to your needs.
The Problem: Traditional clipboards only remember your last copy. You lose valuable content the moment you copy something new.
The Solution: ClipAura maintains a complete history of everything you copy, with intelligent categorization, powerful search, and instant access through customizable shortcuts.
